CHALLENGE STATEMENT
Problem: Individuals, businesses, and organizations struggle to find reliable solutions and experts in diverse fields such as technology, research, marketing, education, etc. Conversely, experts face challenges in locating suitable projects and establishing trust with clients due to the lack of a centralized platform. This results in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for both parties.
Solution: To address this challenge, we developed an online web platform named TASKIFY. This platform aims to provide a user-friendly, transparent, and secure environment where experts and clients can easily connect and collaborate. The proposed solution includes bringing projects, tasks, and job postings into one centralized place, facilitating easy, fast, and reliable communication between clients and experts, and ensuring security. The ultimate goal is to connect clients and experts to satisfy their needs efficiently.
Scope and Limitations of the Portfolio Project
What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve:
Job Security and Long-term Employment: While TASKIFY facilitates project-based work, it does not guarantee long-term job security for experts or freelancers. It provides a platform for finding and completing projects but does not replace the stability of full-time employment.
Skill Matching and Training: The platform does not offer training programs or skill enhancement courses. It assumes that users already possess the necessary skills and expertise to complete the tasks and projects available.
Guaranteed Success for All Users: The platform cannot ensure that every client will find the perfect expert or that every expert will find suitable projects. Success on the platform is dependent on individual profiles, skills, and the demand for specific services.
Handling Disputes and Quality Assurance: While the platform can facilitate connections and transactions, it cannot fully guarantee the quality of work or manage disputes between clients and experts. Dispute resolution mechanisms and quality assurance processes need to be defined but will not be foolproof.

Infrastructure
Branching and Merging Process
Branching Strategy: GitHub Flow
Main Branch:
The main branch is the production-ready branch that always contains the latest stable release of the code.
Direct commits to main are not allowed to ensure stability.
Feature Branches:
Developers create feature branches from the main branch for new features, bug fixes, or experiments.
Naming convention: feature/feature-name or bugfix/bug-description.
Pull Requests (PRs):
Once a feature or bug fix is complete, a pull request is created to merge the feature branch into main.
PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before merging.
Automated tests must pass before the PR can be merged.
Merging:
After approval, the feature branch is merged into main using a merge commit to maintain a clear history.
Conflicts must be resolved by the developer who created the PR, and the branch must be rebased if necessary to ensure a clean merge.
Continuous Integration (CI):
Each push to a feature branch triggers automated testing via CI tools like GitHub Actions, ensuring code quality before it reaches main.
Branch-Merge Strategy:
Rebasing: Before merging, rebase the feature branch onto the latest main to ensure a linear history and minimize conflicts.
Squash Merging: For small changes or fixes, use squash merging to keep the commit history clean.
Deployment Strategy
Staging Environment:
Changes merged into the main branch are automatically deployed to a staging environment using CI/CD tools.
The staging environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
Automated Tests:
Before deploying to staging, all automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) must pass.
Manual testing is performed in the staging environment to catch any issues missed by automated tests.
Production Deployment:
Once changes are verified in staging, they are deployed to production.
Deployment is automated using CI/CD tools, with manual approval required for final deployment to ensure human oversight.
Deployment follows a blue-green strategy to minimize downtime and allow for quick rollback in case of issues.
Monitoring and Rollback:
Post-deployment, monitor the application using tools like New Relic or Datadog to ensure stability.
In case of critical issues, rollback to the previous stable release is performed automatically.
Data Population Strategy
Initial Data Load:
Database Seeding: Use scripts to seed the database with initial data necessary for the platform’s functionality. This includes default categories, roles, sample projects, and users.
Data Migration: For existing data, use migration scripts to import data into the new system.
Ongoing Data Management:
Admin Panel: Provide an admin interface to manage and update data dynamically.
APIs: Allow data to be populated via RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
Testing Data:
Use mock data for development and testing environments to simulate real-world usage without compromising actual user data.
Testing Tools, Automation, and Processes
Automated Testing:
Unit Tests: frameworks like Jest for JavaScript and Mocha for Node.js to test individual units of code.
Integration Tests: tools like Supertest to test interactions between different parts of the system.
End-to-End Tests: Cypress or Selenium to simulate user interactions and test the entire application flow.
Continuous Integration (CI):
GitHub Actions: we shall Automate the running of tests on each push and pull request.
Code Coverage:tools like Istanbul/NYC to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
Static Code Analysis:
ESLint: Enforce coding standards and detect potential issues in JavaScript code.
Prettier: Automatically format code to maintain consistency.
Code Review Process:
Mandatory code reviews for all pull requests to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
Use GitHub’s built-in review tools for commenting and approving changes.
Manual Testing:
Staging Environment: Perform manual tests in the staging environment to catch any issues missed by automated tests.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct UAT sessions with a subset of end-users to validate the application meets their needs.
